- Dataset A4.1 Proteomic codon usage and distortion data of 402 prokaryotes, including
environmental data on optimal growth temperature, pH, and salt concentration
(Uniprot Reference Proteome cross-referenced with BacDive).

- Dataset A4.2 A sample of 3873 archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic taxa, with codon
usages and temperature as an optimal environmental condition (Uniprot Reference
Proteome cross-referenced with Engqvist ).

- Dataset A4.3 The sub-sample of Dataset A4.1 containing 64 prokaryotic taxa (8
archaeal and 56 bacterial) used to conduct the phylogenetic analysis. (link)
